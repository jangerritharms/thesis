\chapter{Discussion}
In this work we presented a strategy-proof mechanism for information dissemination. Applied to our 
distributed blockchain based trust system we are able to effectively defend against dissemination 
and verification free-riders. It creates an incentive for each agent on the network to help defend 
the network against any lazy or malicious behavior. It thereby is a major step towards a secure, 
distributed and scalable trust system.

* we defined a new blockchain system based on TrustChain which provides internal agent state 
transparency/gossip transparency
* we formally proof that the architecture provides a complete view of the internal state of the 
agent
* we defined a specific mechanism that makes use of the archiecture
* we experimentally proof that honest agents are able to eventually identify free-riders and malicious
agents

\section{Future research}

\subsection{Further developing this mechanism}
* incremental 
* research scalability properties for this mechanism
* locality by interacting with those that have similar information
* sybil attack resistance by checking that new agents paid their dues

\subsection{Next steps for the trust system}
* locality with ping
*
